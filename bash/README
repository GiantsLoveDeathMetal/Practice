BASH

    Most of the things I have written in
    bash actually live in my .bash_alias
    file, which itself lives in a pvt
    repo. However, I do have this neat
    function which I wrote:

    Prints all directories in file, then offers
    indexes to change into those directories

dl() {
    DIR="$(pwd)"
    files=(*/)

    for (( i=0; i<${#files[@]} ; i+=2 ));
    do
        printf "%s) ${blue}%-25s${normal} | %s) ${blue}%-25s${normal}\n" "$i" "${files[i]}" "$((i+1))" "${files[i+1]}"
    done

    echo "Choose a directory [0-n/N]"
    read -p "> " i
    i=${i:-N}
    if [ $i == 'N' ]
    then
        return
    fi
    result="$DIR/${files[$i]}"
    cd "$result";
}


TODO; Separate pvt and public functions to
open source my dotrc repo.

Have a look at this:
